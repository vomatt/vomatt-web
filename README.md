# Sanity + Next.js + Vercel Starter Template

> A example of a Vercel-deployable project with a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) frontend and a [Sanity Studio](https://www.sanity.io) on /sanity

## üìÉ Set Up

Clone this repository from your GitHub or Click [Use this template](https://github.com/View-Source-Dev/starter-next-js-sanity/generate).

### 1) Sanity

1. `npm install && npm create sanity@latest init --env`
2. During Sanity's initialization, it will prompt you with a warning. Type Y or n and hit enter.

```
? Select project to use... (Create new project)
? Select organization to attach project to... (None)
? Use the default dataset configuration? (Y)
? Would you like to add configuration files for a Sanity project in this Next.js folder? (Y)
? Do you want to use TypeScript? (n)
? Would you like an embedded Sanity Studio? (n)
? File /sanity.cli.js already exists. Do you want to overwrite it? (n)
? Select project template to use... (Clean project with no predefined schemas)
? File /sanity/schema.js already exists. Do you want to overwrite it? (n)
? File /sanity/env.js already exists. Do you want to overwrite it? (n)
? File /sanity/lib/client.js already exists. Do you want to overwrite it? (n)
? File /sanity/lib/image.js already exists. Do you want to overwrite it? (n)
? Would you like to add the project ID and dataset to your .env file? (Y)
? Package manager to use for installing dependencies? (npm)
```

3. Add CORS Origins to your newly created Sanity project by visiting manage.sanity.io and navigating to Settings ‚Üí API. Then, add your Studio URLs with credentials, such as http://localhost:3000.

### 2) NextJS

1. Update or add the following variables in the `.env` file within the project folder:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET=production
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=XXXXXX
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_API_TOKEN=XXXXXX
NEXT_PUBLIC_REVALIDATE_TIME=60
SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000

// Required for Klaviyo forms:
KLAVIYO_API_KEY=XXXXXX

// Required for Mailchimp forms:
MAILCHIMP_API_KEY=XXXXXX-usX
MAILCHIMP_SERVER=usX

// Required for Sendgrid:
SENDGRID_API_KEY=XXXXXX
```

2. Here's where to find each value:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID`: You can find this after initializing Sanity, either from the `studio/sanity.json` file or from your Sanity dashboard.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_API_TOKEN`: Generate an API token for your Sanity project. Access your project from the Sanity Manage dashboard and navigate to "Settings" ‚Üí "API" ‚Üí "Add New Token" button. Make sure to give it `read + write` access!
- `KLAVIYO_API_KEY`: Create a Private API Key from your Klaviyo Account "Settings" ‚Üí "API Keys"
- `MAILCHIMP_API_KEY`: Create an API key from "Account ‚Üí "Extras" ‚Üí API Keys"
- `MAILCHIMP_SERVER`: This is the server your account is from. It's in the URL when logged in and at the end of your API Key.
- `SENDGRID_API_KEY`: Create an API key from "Settings" ‚Üí "API Keys" with "Restricted Access" only to "Mail Send".

# üèÉüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èGetting Started

# üöÄ Deployment

### Vercel

This setup seamlessly integrates with Vercel, which I highly recommend as your preferred hosting provider. Follow the on-screen instructions to set up your new project. Be sure to **add the same `.env.local` variables to your Vercel Project.**

For further details, refer to our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment).

### Sanity

This step is easy. From the `/sanity` folder in your project, simply run `sanity deploy`. Choose a subdomain, and your Studio will be accessible via the web. This is where you can invite clients to manage the project, add billing info, and edit content.

# üí° Extras/Tips

- `Error: Failed to communicate with the Sanity API` - If you encounter this error, log out and log back in again. Run `sanity logout` and then `sanity login` to resolve it.
- **_How can I see the bundle size of my website?_** Run `npm run analyze` from your project folder. This will build your site and automatically display the [Webpack Bundle Analyzer](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/webpack-bundle-analyzer) for your site's build files.
